A simple delay calculator made in C++ that also can be used to generate reverb presets based on a given BPM.

It takes a BPM and displays a table with a wide range of time divisions and their respective value in milliseconds. 
This can be useful when dialing time based audio effects like sidechain compression, delay, reverb, etc. 
It can also return the parameter values for some common reverb types according to the given BPM.
